# Fake-News-Classification

## Introduction  
This project addresses the growing issue of fake news by leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning classifiers. Fake news has the potential to mislead people and cause serious harm. Identifying such misinformation automatically can help reduce its impact on society.

--- 

## Objective  
To build a classification model that can accurately differentiate between real and fake news articles using text-based features.

---

## Dataset  
- **Name:** `WELFake_Dataset.csv`  
- **Source:** Includes labeled news articles classified as *Fake* or *True*  
- **Features Used:** Mainly the `text` content of the articles

--- 

## Process Overview  

### Data Preprocessing  
- Tokenization using `nltk`  
- Removing stopwords and punctuation  
- Lemmatization using `WordNetLemmatizer`  
- TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into numeric features  

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Word clouds to visualize common terms  
- Class distribution analysis  
- Sample inspection using `pandas`   

### Model Building  
Several models were trained for comparison:
- Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB)  
- Bernoulli Naive Bayes (BNB)  
- Logistic Regression (LR)   

### Evaluation Metrics  
- Accuracy  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Classification Report  
- ROC-AUC Score  
- ROC Curve using `RocCurveDisplay`

## Results  
- **Logistic Regression** showed the best performance with an accuracy of **~95%**.  
- **Multinomial Naive Bayes** achieved ~93% accuracy.  
- **Bernoulli Naive Bayes** achieved ~91% accuracy.  
- Word clouds provided insight into commonly used words in both real and fake news.  
- The model successfully distinguishes between fake and real news articles.

## Tools and Libraries  
- `Pandas`, `NumPy` for data manipulation  
- `NLTK` for text preprocessing  
- `Scikit-learn` for modeling and evaluation  
- `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Plotly` for visualization  
- `WordCloud` for graphical insights

## Conclusion  
The project successfully demonstrated that NLP techniques combined with machine learning algorithms can be used to detect fake news with high accuracy. Such a system can be deployed in news aggregators, social media, or browser plugins to alert users about misinformation.
